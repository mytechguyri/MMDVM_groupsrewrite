Pistar-Update pulls in a groups.txt file from BrandMeister only
this adds other DMR networks to the groups.txt file and prepends 
the network name so that the group name will show up for all the 
networks you're connected to in a multi-network system

This was developed for my own use, so I only utilized the 5 networks
I connect to.   Feel free to change it to suit your needs.  
the code is pretty self explanatory, but if you have questions
I can be reached at john at wa1okb.radio
